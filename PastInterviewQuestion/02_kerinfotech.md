[click](../06_Node_Express/newnotes/optimize.md#L81)

### 11. How are you structuring your backend using Express.js in your projects?

- I use a **modular structure**:
  - Separate **routes**, **controllers**, and **models** into folders.
  - Use **middleware** for common tasks (auth, error handling).
  - Keep server setup clean in a main file (`app.js` or `server.js`).

[click](../06_Node_Express/newnotes/optimize.md#L82)

### 2. Let’s say someone gets access to your API endpoint — how would you protect against unauthorized access?

- I’d protect API endpoints using **authentication** like JWT tokens.
- **authorization** to ensure users access only allowed data.
- **HTTPS** to encrypt data and secure communication.

### 3. What backend strategies do you use if the frontend team forgets to add proper security checks (e.g. repeated form submissions)?

- I would implement **rate limiting** to limit the number of requests per user/IP.
