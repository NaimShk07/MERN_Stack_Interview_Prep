# Node.js Interview Questions and Sample Answers

---

## 1. Tell me about yourself

**Purpose:** To assess communication skills and clarity of thought.

**Sample Answer:**

> "I am a Node.js developer with 2 years of experience building backend APIs and scalable web applications. I enjoy solving complex problems and optimizing server-side performance. In my previous role, I worked on a project that involved integrating third-party APIs and improving database efficiency, which reduced response time by 30%. I am passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and collaborating closely with front-end teams to deliver high-quality products."

## 2. Describe a challenging bug or issue you faced and how you resolved it

**Purpose:** Tests problem-solving, technical approach, and resilience.

**Sample Answer:**

> "In a recent project, we noticed intermittent performance issues in our Node.js API. After profiling the application, I discovered that database queries were not properly indexed, causing delays during peak traffic. I added appropriate indexes and refactored the queries to reduce unnecessary joins. I also implemented caching for frequently requested data. These changes reduced API response time by 40%, and I documented the fix so the team could prevent similar issues in the future."

## 3. How do you handle tight deadlines or multiple tasks?

**Purpose:** Assesses time management and prioritization.

**Sample Answer:**

> "I prioritize tasks based on impact and deadlines. For example, if a critical bug arises, I address it first, while less urgent features are scheduled afterward. I also break larger tasks into smaller, manageable parts and track progress daily. During a recent sprint, I had to implement a new API while fixing a production bug. I planned my day to spend mornings on the bug and afternoons on the new feature, ensuring both were completed without compromising quality."

## 4. Tell me about a time you had to work in a team with conflicting opinions

**Purpose:** Tests collaboration and conflict resolution.

**Sample Answer:**

> "While working on a project, our team disagreed on using MongoDB versus PostgreSQL for a new feature. I suggested we list pros and cons and consider future scalability. We also created a small prototype for both approaches. After analyzing the results, the team agreed PostgreSQL was more suitable for our use case. By staying objective and focusing on data-driven decisions, we resolved the conflict efficiently."

## 5. How do you keep up with new technologies and Node.js updates?

**Purpose:** Shows initiative and commitment to learning.

**Sample Answer:**

> "I follow Node.js release notes, read blogs like RisingStack and NodeSource, and participate in community discussions on GitHub and Stack Overflow. I also enjoy experimenting with new libraries in small personal projects before considering them for work. For instance, I recently explored async hooks and worker threads to optimize a high-load API in one of my projects."

## 6. Give an example of a time you received constructive feedback and how you handled it

**Purpose:** Tests openness to learning and growth.

**Sample Answer:**

> "During a code review, a senior developer pointed out that some of my API routes were not following the project’s naming conventions. I thanked them for the feedback, refactored my code to match the standard, and added comments to improve clarity. Since then, I make it a habit to double-check naming conventions before submitting code, which has improved both my productivity and the team’s code quality."

## 7. Describe a situation when you had to quickly learn something new to complete a project

**Purpose:** Tests adaptability and learning ability.

**Sample Answer:**

> "In one project, we needed to integrate a payment gateway I hadn’t worked with before. I spent a few hours reading the documentation and experimenting with a sandbox environment. I then implemented the integration in the project, tested it thoroughly, and documented the process for the team. The project was delivered on time, and the payment system worked smoothly from day one."
