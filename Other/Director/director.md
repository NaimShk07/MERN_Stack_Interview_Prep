## About You & Your Career Goals

1. Tell me about yourself.
2. What are your strengths and weaknesses?

- My main strengths are `problem-solving`, writing `clean` and `maintainable` code, and `adapting quickly` to new technologies. I also take `ownership` of my work and enjoy collaborating with my team.

- Sometimes I get too `focused` on `perfecting` small details, but I’ve learned to balance `quality` with `timely delivery`.

3. What do you want in your career long-term?

- Long term, I want to become a strong full stack engineer — someone who can handle both `technical challenges` and `product thinking`.
- I want to work on `impactful projects` that help `users` and help the `company` grow, while continuously improving my skills.

> Show that you think about growth and contribution, not just salary or titles.

4. Where do you see yourself in 3-5 years?

- In the next 3–5 years, I see myself `leading projects`, `mentoring juniors`, and being someone who can take `ownership` from `planning to deployment`. I also want to keep learning — especially in `system design` and `scalability` — to grow into a senior MERN stack developer.

5. Why did you choose web development / the MERN stack?

- I chose web development because I love seeing `immediate results` of my work building something that people can actually use.
- I picked the MERN stack because it allows me to `handle` both frontend and backend using one language, JavaScript.
- It’s `fast`, `scalable`, and `widely used` in modern startups, which makes it perfect for building end-to-end applications.

## Project and Process Understanding

1. Tell me about the project we gave you — how did you approach it?

- The task was to build a BOGO (Buy One Get One) offer-based product management system using the MERN stack.
- My first step was to `break` the `problem` into `smaller parts` — `backend API setup`, `database schema`, and `frontend integration`.
- I started by `designing` the `MongoDB models`, then `created REST APIs` using Express and Node.js for `product management` and `discount logic`.
- After the backend was stable, I connected it with React on the frontend and made sure the UI clearly showed active offers and their conditions.
- My focus was to keep the structure clean, readable, and easily extendable if new discount rules are added later.”

> Planning, modular approach, clean structure, scalability

2. What challenges did you face, and how did you solve them?

- One challenge was handling the offer logic — making sure the BOGO condition applied correctly without affecting other products.
- I solved it by writing a clear validation layer in the backend and testing multiple edge cases like odd quantities or expired offers.
- Another small challenge was keeping the frontend synced with backend updates, so I used React state management properly to reflect changes instantly.

3. If we gave you more time/resources, how would you improve your solution?

- With more time, I’d improve the project in a few ways:
  - Add JWT-based authentication and role-based access (admin/user).
  - Improve UI design and responsiveness.
  - Implement better error handling and loading states.
  - Add test cases and maybe integrate Redux Toolkit for cleaner state management.
    These improvements would make the project more production-ready and scalable.

4. How do you prioritize tasks when working under a deadline?

- I start by understanding which tasks are most critical for the core functionality. I prioritize building the backbone — the working logic and APIs — before polishing the UI.
- I usually make a short checklist, break tasks into small milestones, and test after each phase.
- This helps me deliver a working project on time while keeping room for improvements if time allows

- I take feedback very positively. I see it as a chance to learn and improve. If there’s ever a conflict, I prefer to communicate directly and calmly, understand the other person’s point of view, and focus on solving the problem rather than proving a point. I believe clear communication and mutual respect can resolve most issues quickly.

## Decision-Making & Ownership

1. Have you ever taken ownership of a project from start to finish?

- Yes, I’ve taken ownership of a few projects. One example is the EV Charging Station Admin Panel I worked on.
- I handled both the frontend and backend — from setting up APIs in Node.js and Express to integrating them with the Angular dashboard.
- I was responsible for ensuring proper data flow, error handling, and testing before deployment.
- I also coordinated with the designer for UI consistency.
- Taking end-to-end responsibility helped me understand the importance of planning, communication, and timely delivery.

2. Can you give an example of a time you made a mistake, and how you handled it?

- In one project, I deployed a minor frontend update without double-checking the API version, which caused a small data mismatch on production.
- As soon as I noticed it, I immediately informed my team, rolled back the change, and fixed the versioning issue.
- After that, I added a small checklist for deployment verification to avoid similar issues in the future.
- That experience taught me how small checks can prevent big problems — and the importance of communication when something goes wrong.

3. Do you prefer working alone or in a team?

- I’m comfortable with both, but I enjoy working in a team because it brings different ideas and helps deliver better results.
- At the same time, I can work independently when needed — especially on focused tasks like backend logic or feature development.
- I believe the best results come when everyone takes ownership of their part but works together towards the same goal.

## Motivation & Attitude

1. What motivates you?

- What motivates me most is seeing my work come to life — when a feature I build actually solves a problem or improves the user experience.
- I also get motivated by learning new things and pushing myself to do better with each project. When I see my code running smoothly and making someone’s job easier, that gives me real satisfaction.

2. What do you do when you're stuck or frustrated during coding?

- Whenever I get stuck, I first take a step back and try to understand the root cause calmly instead of rushing.
- I usually debug logically, search documentation, or check community solutions. If it still doesn’t work, I ask a teammate for a quick second opinion — sometimes a fresh pair of eyes solves it faster.
- I’ve learned that staying patient and approaching the problem step-by-step always leads to a solution.

3. How do you keep up with new tech in the MERN stack?

- I keep myself updated by following official docs, YouTube channels like Traversy Media and Web Dev Simplified, and blogs on sites like freeCodeCamp and Medium.
- I also like experimenting with small side projects whenever a new library or update comes out — that helps me learn practically instead of just reading.

## Compensation / Practical Questions (if not already covered)

1. What are your salary expectations?

- Based on my experience and the MERN stack role responsibilities, I’m expecting somewhere around 4.5 to 4.8 LPA.
- But I’m flexible if the role offers good learning opportunities and long-term growth.

2. Are you open to relocation / remote work?

- I’m looking for an onsite role in Ahmedabad only. I’m already settled here, and I prefer working from the office because it helps in better communication and learning from the team.

3. When can you join?

- Officially, I have a 60-day notice period, but since my current project is ending and there’s no active web project, my release can be negotiated earlier.
- I can coordinate with my current company and try to join sooner if required.
