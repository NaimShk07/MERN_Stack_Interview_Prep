- [ ] Express Router + modularization  
- [ ] Error handling patterns  
- [ ] Async middleware  
- [ ] Environment variables  
- [ ] Authentication (JWT)  
- [ ] File uploads (Multer + S3 optional)  

### **Practical**
- [ ] Build production-ready folder structure  
- [ ] CRUD API with validation  
- [ ] Create JWT login/signup  
- [ ] Middleware for auth  
- [ ] API rate limiting  
- [ ] Logging (Morgan / Winston)  

---

## 📍 Phase 4 — Databases: MongoDB + MySQL

### **MongoDB (Primary for MERN)**
- [ ] Schema design strategies  
- [ ] Reference vs Embed  
- [ ] Indexes & performance  
- [ ] Aggregation pipeline  
- [ ] Mongoose middleware (pre/post hooks)  
- [ ] Validation  

### **Mongo Practical**
- [ ] Create user/product schemas  
- [ ] Implement aggregation for analytics  
- [ ] Write optimized queries  
- [ ] Indexing for read/write improvement  

### **MySQL (If required by company)**
- [ ] Joins  
- [ ] Normalization  
- [ ] Stored procedures (optional)  

---

## 📍 Phase 5 — Fullstack Integration

### **Theory**
- [ ] REST API structure  
- [ ] Authentication flow (frontend + backend)  
- [ ] CORS  
- [ ] Deployment flow  
- [ ] Security basics (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, JWT safety)  

### **Practical**
- [ ] Connect React → Node API  
- [ ] Implement protected routes (frontend + backend)  
- [ ] Build a small fullstack feature (e.g., Todo + Auth)  

---

## 📍 Phase 6 — DevOps & Tools (2y Developer Must Know)

### Git
- [ ] Branching strategy  
- [ ] Merge vs Rebase  
- [ ] Pull requests  

### AWS (Advantageous)
- [ ] S3 (upload & retrieve)  
- [ ] EC2 deployment flow  
- [ ] Lambda basics  

### Other Tools
- [ ] Postman  
- [ ] Docker basics (optional but strong advantage)

## 📍 Phase 7 — Soft Skills & HR Prep
- [ ] Project explanation (architecture + decisions)  
- [ ] Challenges you solved  
- [ ] Team collaboration examples  
- [ ] Strengths/weaknesses  
- [ ] Expected salary discussion  
- [ ] Explain technical concepts simply  

---

## 📍 Phase 8 — Mock Interview Checklist
