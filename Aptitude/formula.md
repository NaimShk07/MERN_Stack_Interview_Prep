## 🧮 1. Percentage

📌 **Definition:**  
Percentage means "out of 100" and is used to compare values.

**Formula:**  
`Percentage = (Value / Total Value) × 100`

**Example:**  
If a student scored 45 out of 60:  
`= (45 / 60) × 100 = 75% ✅`

**🧪 Detailed Question:**  
Q: In a class of 50 students, 30% failed in Math and 20% failed in English. If 10% failed in both, how many passed in both subjects?

**Solution:**  
Use `A + B - Both` formula.  
Failed in at least one = 30 + 20 - 10 = 40%  
So passed in both = 100 - 40 = 60%  
Hence, `60% of 50 = 30 students ✅`

## ⚡ 2. Profit and Loss

📌 **Definition:**  
Used to calculate gain or loss in a transaction.

**Formulas:**

- `Profit = SP - CP`
- `Loss = CP - SP`
- `Profit% = (Profit / CP) × 100`
- `Loss% = (Loss / CP) × 100`

**🧪 Detailed Question:**  
Q: A shopkeeper buys a pen for ₹80 and sells it at a 25% profit. What is the selling price?

**Solution:**  
`Profit% = 25% of 80 = (25/100)×80 = ₹20`  
So `SP = CP + Profit = 80 + 20 = ₹100 ✅`

---

## 💰 3. Simple Interest (SI)

📌 **Definition:**  
Interest calculated on principal amount for a given time and rate.

**Formula:**  
`SI = (P × R × T) / 100`

**🧪 Detailed Question:**  
Q: Find the SI on ₹10,000 for 3 years at 8% p.a.

**Solution:**  
`SI = (10000 × 8 × 3) / 100 = ₹2400 ✅`

---

## 🕒 4. Time, Speed & Distance

📌 **Definition:**  
Relationship between distance, speed, and time.

**Formulas:**

- `Speed = Distance / Time`
- `Time = Distance / Speed`
- `Distance = Speed × Time`

**🧪 Detailed Question:**  
Q: A car covers 300 km in 5 hours. What is its speed?

**Solution:**  
`Speed = Distance / Time = 300 / 5 = 60 km/h ✅`

---

## 🧪 5. Average

**Formulas:**  
`a/b = c/d` → `a : b :: c : d`

**🧪 Detailed Question:**  
Q: If A:B = 2:3 and B:C = 4:5, find A:C.

**Solution:**  
Make B same → A:B:C = 2×4 : 3×4 : 3×5 = 8:12:15  
So, `A:C = 8:15 ✅`

---

## ⏱️ 7. Time and Work

📌 **Definition:**  
Used to calculate work done by people in a given time.

**Formulas:**

- `A’s 1 day work = 1/x`
- `B’s 1 day work = 1/y`
- `Together = 1/x + 1/y`

**🧪 Detailed Question:**  
Q: A can do a work in 6 days, B in 3 days. Together how long?

**Solution:**  
`A’s 1 day = 1/6`, `B’s = 1/3`  
`Together = (1/6 + 1/3) = 1/2`  
So they finish in `2 days ✅`

---

## 📊 8. Average Speed

📌 **Definition:**  
Used when the same distance is covered at different speeds.

**Formula:**  
`Average Speed = (2xy) / (x + y)`

**🧪 Detailed Question:**  
Q: A car goes to a city at 60 km/h and returns at 40 km/h. Find the average speed.

**Solution:**  
`= (2 × 60 × 40) / (60 + 40) = 4800 / 100 = 48 km/h ✅`

---

## ⏳ 9. Ages

📌 **Definition:**  
Used to calculate current, past, or future ages.

**🧪 Detailed Question:**  
Q: A is twice as old as B. Five years ago, A was three times as old as B. Find their present ages.

**Solution:**  
Let B = x → A = 2x  
5 years ago: 2x - 5 = 3(x - 5)  
`2x - 5 = 3x - 15 → x = 10`  
So, B = 10, A = 20 ✅

---

## 🚆 10. Trains

📌 **Definition:**  
Problems on trains involve length, speed, and time.

**Formula:**  
`Speed = (Distance / Time) × (18/5)`

**🧪 Detailed Question:**  
Q: A 150m train crosses a pole in 10s. Find its speed in km/h.

**Solution:**  
`Speed = (150 / 10) × (18/5) = 15 × 3.6 = 54 km/h ✅`

---

## 🧩 11. HCF & LCM

📌 **Definition:**  
HCF → greatest common divisor  
LCM → smallest multiple of numbers

**Relation:**  
`HCF × LCM = Product of Numbers`

**🧪 Detailed Question:**  
Q: Find HCF and LCM of 12 and 15.

**Solution:**  
Factors: 12 = 2²×3, 15 = 3×5  
`HCF = 3`, `LCM = (12×15)/3 = 60 ✅`

---

## 🎲 12. Probability
